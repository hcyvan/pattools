# Introduction
The PAT format was first proposed in wgbstools ([Github](https://github.com/nloyfer/wgbs_tools)) {cite}`Loyfer2024.05.08.593132`.
This format is compressed and indexed, providing comprehensive information about methylation patterns while excluding
the subjects' private DNA sequence data. Therefore, the pat format can effectively facilitate the transmission and
sharing of methylation data.

To this end, we developed pattools, a supplementary extension of wgbstools, to support the analysis of pat format data.
Pattools currently offers the following functionalities:

+ Multiple methylation deconvolution algorithms
+ Methylation beta value analysis
+ Methylation entropy analysis
+ Methylation vector analysis
