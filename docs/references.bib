	abstract = {Next-generation methylation-aware sequencing of DNA sheds light on the fundamental role of methylation in cellular function in health and disease. These data are commonly represented at a single CpG resolution, while single-molecule fragment-level analysis is often overlooked.Here, we present wgbstools, an extensive computational suite tailored for methylation sequencing data. wgbstools allows fast access and ultra-compact anonymized representation of high-throughput methylome data, obtained through various library preparation and sequencing methods. Additionally, wgbstools contains state-of-the-art algorithms for genomic segmentation, biomarker identification, genetic and epigenetic data integration, and more. wgbstools offers fragment-level analysis and informative visualizations, across multiple genomic regions and samples.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.WGBSwhole-genome bisulfite sequencingRRBSreduced representation bisulfite-sequencingEM-seqenzymatic methylation sequencingDMRdifferentially methylated regionsDMBdifferentially methylated blocksPCRpolymerase chain Reaction},

	abstract = {Plasma consists of DNA released from multiple tissues within the body. Using genome-wide bisulfite sequencing of plasma DNA, we obtained a birdâ€™s eye view of the identities and contributions of these tissues to the circulating DNA pool. The tissue contributors and their relative proportions are identified by a bioinformatics deconvolution process that draws reference from DNA methylation signatures representative of each tissue type. We validated this approach in pregnant women, cancer patients, and transplant recipients. This method also allows one to identify the tissue of origin of genomic aberrations observed in plasma DNA. This approach has numerous research and diagnostic applications in prenatal testing, oncology, transplantation monitoring, and other fields., Plasma consists of DNA released from multiple tissues within the body. Using genome-wide bisulfite sequencing of plasma DNA and deconvolution of the sequencing data with reference to methylation profiles of different tissues, we developed a general approach for studying the major tissue contributors to the circulating DNA pool. We tested this method in pregnant women, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and subjects following bone marrow and liver transplantation. In most subjects, white blood cells were the predominant contributors to the circulating DNA pool. The placental contributions in the plasma of pregnant women correlated with the proportional contributions as revealed by fetal-specific genetic markers. The graft-derived contributions to the plasma in the transplant recipients correlated with those determined using donor-specific genetic markers. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma showed elevated plasma DNA contributions from the liver, which correlated with measurements made using tumor-associated copy number aberrations. In hepatocellular carcinoma patients and in pregnant women exhibiting copy number aberrations in plasma, comparison of methylation deconvolution results using genomic regions with different copy number status pinpointed the tissue type responsible for the aberrations. In a pregnant woman diagnosed as having follicular lymphoma during pregnancy, methylation deconvolution indicated a grossly elevated contribution from B cells into the plasma DNA pool and localized B cells as the origin of the copy number aberrations observed in plasma. This method may serve as a powerful tool for assessing a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions based on the identification of perturbed proportional contributions of different tissues into plasma.},

	abstract = {Methylation patterns of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) contain rich information about recent cell death events in the body. Here, we present an approach for unbiased determination of the tissue origins of cfDNA, using a reference methylation atlas of 25 human tissues and cell types. The method is validated using in silico simulations as well as in vitro mixes of DNA from different tissue sources at known proportions. We show that plasma cfDNA of healthy donors originates from white blood cells (55\%), erythrocyte progenitors (30\%), vascular endothelial cells (10\%) and hepatocytes (1\%). Deconvolution of cfDNA from patients reveals tissue contributions that agree with clinical findings in sepsis, islet transplantation, cancer of the colon, lung, breast and prostate, and cancer of unknown primary. We propose a procedure which can be easily adapted to study the cellular contributors to cfDNA in many settings, opening a broad window into healthy and pathologic human tissue dynamics.},
